hi kenny, can you connect via ethernet please?

ok

thanks

ok on lan


can you reconnect the lan? it is only auto negotiating to 100mbps and also no dhcp
its a 100mb usb to lan thing - let me check dhcp

okay now i can see dhcp, do you have a 1 gig adapter? not here unfortunately, but you connect fine with this one last time
hmm okay i will try again
very close, can we align the Subtotal, vat and total with the box above it - and we still seem to be adding vat when our prices include vat - so the Denon AVR-X1800h total including vat should be R16790 and the vat amount should be R2190

with regards to customer details, can we perhaps ask the client for the necessary information when clicking request quote, which then adds it to the invoice?
